🚀 ML Pipeline Overview
🔹 1. Data Preprocessing & Cleaning
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling and normalization

🔹 2. Dimensionality Reduction
Applied PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to reduce feature space and visualize data

🔹 3. Feature Selection
Selected top features based on correlation and model-based techniques

🔹 4. Supervised Learning
Trained and evaluated multiple classification models:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
SVM

🔹 5. Unsupervised Learning
Clustered data using:
K-Means
Hierarchical Clustering

🔹 6. Hyperparameter Tuning
Used GridSearchCV & RandomizedSearchCV for model optimization
